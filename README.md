# WP2Static

http://mnl.space/WP2Static/

This is a proof of concept for hosting a website for free using github but still using CMS Wordpress to manage the website.

This is done by converting the dynamic wordpress pages into static pages that can be hosted for free on Github which provides a free static website hosting service called Github Pages. The final product is the website http://mnl.space/WP2Static. Github allows for custom domain names and https.
