# WP2Static

http://mnl.space/WP2Static/

This is a proof of concept for hosting a website for free using github but still using CMS Wordpress to manage the website.

This is done be converting the dynamic web pages that get generated from Wordpress into static pages that can be hosted on Github which provides a free static website hosting site called Github Pages. The final product is the website http://mnl.space/WP2Static. Github allows for custom domain names and https certificates.
